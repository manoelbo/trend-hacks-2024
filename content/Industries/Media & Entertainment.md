## Escaping Through Entertainment

Brief Summary: In times of economic hardship and social unrest, people often turn to entertainment for comfort and distraction. Successful advertising campaigns have historically understood this desire, bringing moments of joy and levity to consumers. Brands like T-Mobile and Cadbury created memorable adverts that brought levity during economic downturns. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Budweiser revisited their humorous 'Wassup' ad. By aligning with the cues of popular culture, advertisers can create positive emotional associations, even in challenging times.
