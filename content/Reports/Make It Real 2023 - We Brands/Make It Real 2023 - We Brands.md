## Prioritizing the Social in ESG
As businesses navigate ESG initiatives, they are reminded to prioritize the social component. Companies should not lose sight of the people behind the numbers and share stories that illustrate the human benefits and impacts of their ESG efforts, particularly on vulnerable populations.
