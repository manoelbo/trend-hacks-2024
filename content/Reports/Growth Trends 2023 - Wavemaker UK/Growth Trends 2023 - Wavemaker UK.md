## Escaping Through Entertainment
Brief Summary: In times of economic hardship and social unrest, people often turn to entertainment for comfort and distraction. Successful advertising campaigns have historically understood this desire, bringing moments of joy and levity to consumers. Brands like T-Mobile and Cadbury created memorable adverts that brought levity during economic downturns. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Budweiser revisited their humorous 'Wassup' ad. By aligning with the cues of popular culture, advertisers can create positive emotional associations, even in challenging times.

## The Great Domestic Retreat
Brief Summary: The cost of living crisis is pushing people to retract from out-of-home activities and spend more time indoors. Consumers are cutting back on dining out, attractions, retail shopping, and beauty services, shifting their focus on in-home substitutes and premiumised experiences. Brands like M&S capitalized on similar behaviors during the 2008 downturn with their 'dine in' offerings. Brands that acknowledge this shift and offer elevated in-home experiences can maintain relevance and potentially grow during this period of economic constraint.

## Sustainable Choices in a Cost-Conscious Era
Brief Summary: As the cost of living rises, sustainability initiatives risk being deprioritized by consumers due to financial pressures. Brands have an opportunity to introduce sustainability as an inherent part of their offerings rather than an optional (and often more costly) choice. Companies are encouraged to present products that are not only financially viable for consumers but also deliver on sustainability goals. Exploring second-hand markets, subscription models, and product durability are ways to maintain ecological commitments without imposing additional costs on consumers.
