## The Great Domestic Retreat
Brief Summary: The cost of living crisis is pushing people to retract from out-of-home activities and spend more time indoors. Consumers are cutting back on dining out, attractions, retail shopping, and beauty services, shifting their focus on in-home substitutes and premiumised experiences. Brands like M&S capitalized on similar behaviors during the 2008 downturn with their 'dine in' offerings. Brands that acknowledge this shift and offer elevated in-home experiences can maintain relevance and potentially grow during this period of economic constraint.
